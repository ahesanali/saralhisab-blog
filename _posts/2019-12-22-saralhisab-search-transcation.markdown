Generally i visit the saloon monthly. I also log the expense in my diary in [saralhisab app] (https://saralhisab.com).

[Saloon Expense Entry](/images/pages/expense_entry.png)

Once one month pass it's time to cut the hair i have to look inside previous month diary and get the date at which i have visited saloon. But sometimes that saloon expense entry was not found in previous month diary so i have to look two months back and finally i found the entry.

To overcome this issue saralhisab added general search for expense and income transactions. Just hit the search menu in from navigation

[Search menu] (/images/pages/search_menu.png)

Enter your search query and choose the option where you wanted to search and finally hit the search button.

Now i can easily see my recurring expense or income from all transactions. I mean from all the diaries that i have created.
